This step must be repeated everytime a new module is added to the package.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Deploy on Cloud`

Heroku was chosen to deploy this application to the cloud. This can be done by linking the github repo to an heroku app and automatically deploy a branch of the repo.
